## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

ljmp

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?




#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

int 0x10, 0x13, 0x14, 0x18.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

`check_partition` function will check if this partition is Pintos kernel partition by checking `%es:(%si)` and `%es:4(%si)`.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

Output `Not Found` and invoke interruption 0x18.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

After load sectors from hard disk, we read the start address from ELF header. And then use instruction jmp to `*start`.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> #0  palloc_get_page (flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO)) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113
#1  0xc00203aa in paging_init () at ../../threads/init.c:168
#2  0xc002031b in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:100
#3  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x1000

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x0



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> #0  palloc_get_page (flags=PAL_ZERO) at ../../threads/palloc.c:113
#1  0xc0020a81 in thread_create (name=0xc002e895 "idle", priority=0, function=0xc0020eb
0 <idle>, aux=0xc000efbc) at ../../threads/thread.c:178
#2  0xc0020976 in thread_start () at ../../threads/thread.c:111
#3  0xc0020334 in pintos_init () at ../../threads/init.c:119
#4  0xc002013d in start () at ../../threads/start.S:180

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x3000

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 0x102027



## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
